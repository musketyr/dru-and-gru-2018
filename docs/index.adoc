= Dru and Gru Workshop
Vladimír Oraný <https://github.com/musketyr[icon:github[] @musketyr]>

== Getting Started

This workshop will learn you how to use https://agorapulse.github.io/dru/[Dru] for preparing test data and https://agorapulse.github.io/gru/[Gru]
for testing HTTP backends. Although I've made the best effort to keep this workshop self-contained, some of the exercise may need further reading of the following documentation pages:

 * http://docs.grails.org/latest/[Grails 3]
 * https://agorapulse.github.io/dru/[Dru]
 * https://agorapulse.github.io/gru/[Gru]

=== Software Requirements

To get started you need to have installed following:

 * Java Development Kit 8

Project is built using https://gradle.org/[Gradle] build tool but it's using https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle Wrapper]
so you are not required to install it manually nor you don't have to be afraid of version clash.

You can use IDE of your choice but https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA] provides so far the best
Gradle and Groovy integration even in the free Community version and it will be used in live coding sessions during
the workshop.

=== Getting Started

To get started download link:archives/gritter.zip[exercise project archive file] and unzip it. Feel free to ignore
the client part of the application.

____

You have been hired by https://trafficscotland.org/wintergritterinfo/[Traffic Scotland] to finish a Grails application
which wasn't left by a developer who was fired from the company. It's called Gritter (Grails + Twitter) and it purpose is to
share text statuses published by http://scotgov.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=2de764a9303848ffb9a4cac0bd0b1aab[drivers of gritters].

You don't want to be responsible or someone's other mess so first thing you want to do in the new job is to cover the existing
code with tests as there are currently no tests in the project.

As a first task you decided to create a integration tests which verifies that new status can be written.

==== Gru HTTP Testing

Gru provides test support for any HTTP backend, not just Grails. We can use https://agorapulse.github.io/gru/#_http[Gru HTTP] client
inside Grails integration test easily with following setup

.Integration Test Example
----
include::../server/src/integration-test/groovy/gritter/StatusControllerIntegrationSpec.groovy[tag=header]

    void 'create new taks'() {
        expect:
        gru.test {                                                              // <5>
                post '/task', {
                    headers Authentication: 'Bearer TeddyTheBear'               // <6>
                    json inline('{ "text" : "try Gru" }')                       // <7>
                }
                expect {
                    status CREATED                                              // <8>
                    json 'newTaskResponse.json'                                 // <9>
                }
            }
    }

include::../server/src/integration-test/groovy/gritter/StatusControllerIntegrationSpec.groovy[tag=footer]
----
<1> Running integration tests requires `@Integration` annotation to be applied on the class and the file be located under `src/integration-test` folder
<2> Application in integration test environment runs on random port which can be injected into the test
<3> Creates new `Gru` rule with `Http` client
<4> Sets the base URL to the address of the current application under test
<5> Starts Gru test definition
<6> Set the headers
<7> JSON payload can be specified inline or as a file name
<8> Assets that the returned status is `CREATED`
<9> Reference file which is created automatically in `src/test/resources/**/NameOfTheSpec` directory from the actual payload if not present

See https://agorapulse.github.io/gru/#_common_interactions[Common Interaction] section in the documentation for more information.

IMPORTANT: The application uses primitive authentication. Just send plain username such as `John Sno` in `User` header.

IMPORTANT: Some of the properties in the reference JSON file such as timestamps may be different for each request.
Please, read https://agorapulse.github.io/gru/#_json_response[Json Response] documentation to find out how to change the generated fixture to allow variable content.
