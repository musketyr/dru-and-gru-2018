= Dru and Gru Workshop
Vladimír Oraný <https://github.com/musketyr[icon:github[] @musketyr]>

== Getting Started

This workshop will learn you how to use https://agorapulse.github.io/dru/[Dru] for preparing test data and https://agorapulse.github.io/gru/[Gru]
for testing HTTP backends. Although I've made the best effort to keep this workshop self-contained, some of the exercise may need further reading of the following documentation pages:

 * http://docs.grails.org/latest/[Grails 3]
 * http://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.1/index.html[Spock]
 * https://agorapulse.github.io/dru/[Dru]
 * https://agorapulse.github.io/gru/[Gru]

=== Software Requirements

To get started you need to have installed following:

 * http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Java Development Kit 8]

Project is built using https://gradle.org/[Gradle] build tool but it's using https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle Wrapper]
so you are not required to install it manually nor you don't have to be afraid of version clash.

You can use IDE of your choice but https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA] provides so far the best
Gradle and Groovy integration even in the free Community version and it will be used in live coding sessions during
the workshop. Import the project as Gradle project get the best developer experience.

=== Getting Started

To get started download link:archives/gritter.zip[exercise project archive file] and unzip it. Feel free to ignore
the client part of the application. Run following command to get all dependencies downloaded:

```
./gradlew dependencies
```


=== Exercise 1: HTTP Testing

____

You have been hired by https://trafficscotland.org/wintergritterinfo/[Traffic Scotland] to finish a Grails application
which was left by a developer who was fired from the company. It's called Gritter (Grails + Twitter) and it purpose is to
share text statuses published by http://scotgov.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=2de764a9303848ffb9a4cac0bd0b1aab[drivers of gritters].

You don't want to be responsible or someone's other mess so first thing you want to do in the new job is to cover the existing
code with tests as there are currently no tests in the project.

As a first task you decided to create a integration tests which verifies that new Gritter status can be written.
____


==== Gru HTTP Testing

Gru provides test support for any HTTP backend, not just Grails. We can use https://agorapulse.github.io/gru/#_http[Gru HTTP] client
inside Grails integration test easily with following setup.

To get started, create new specification class in `server/src/integration-test/groovy/gritter/StatusControllerIntegrationSpec.groovy` with following content.

[source,groovy,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
.Integration Specification Skeleton
----
include::../server/src/integration-test/groovy/gritter/StatusControllerIntegrationSpec.groovy[tag=header]
include::../server/src/integration-test/groovy/gritter/StatusControllerIntegrationSpec.groovy[tag=footer]
----
<1> Running integration tests requires `@Integration` annotation to be applied on the class and the file be located under `src/integration-test` folder, `@Rollback` ensures that test runs inside transaction which is rolled backed after test execution.
<2> Application in integration test environment runs on random port which can be injected into the test
<3> Creates new `Gru` rule with `Http` client
<4> Sets the base URL to the address of the current application under test

[source,groovy,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
.Create Status Test Method
----
include::../server/src/integration-test/groovy/gritter/StatusControllerIntegrationSpec.groovy[tag=create-status]
----
<1> Just a regular Spock feature method to test status creation
<2> Starts Gru test definition
<3> Tests `POST` to URI `/status`
<4> Adds `User` header to the request
<5> Loads the request body from file `server/src/test/resources/gritter/StatusControllerIntegrationSpec/newStatusRequest.json`
<6> Expect clause adds verification to the test
<7> Asserts that the returned status is `CREATED`
<9> Reference file which is created automatically in `server/src/test/resources/gritter/StatusControllerIntegrationSpec` directory from the actual payload if not present

If you run the test for a first time, both `newStatusRequest.json` and `newStatusResponse.json` are created automatically.

Replace the content of `newStatusRequest.json` file with following:

[source,json]
.newStatusRequest.json
----
include::../server/src/test/resources/gritter/StatusControllerIntegrationSpec/newStatusRequest.json[]
----

Delete the content of `newStatusResponse.json` and run the test again. New content of `newStatusResponse.json` should get generated:

[source,json]
----
{
  "id": 201,
  "created": "2018-05-28T15:08:09Z",
  "text": "No Snow here, let's take a break!",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "username": "John Sno"
  },
  "engagementsCount": 0,
  "engagements": []
}
----

If you run the test again, the test will still not pass as the ids and `created` timestamp changes
every time. Luckily Gru integrates and extends https://github.com/lukas-krecan/JsonUnit[JsonUnit].
If you read  https://agorapulse.github.io/gru/#_json_response[Json Response] documentation you find out how to change the generated fixture to allow variable content.
You can use JSON Unit placeholders. `${json-unit.matches:positiveIntegerString}` is great way how to match
autogenerated ids. `${json-unit.matches:isoDateNow}` helps with matching timestamps which are not older than an hour.
At the end your `newStatusResponse.json` should look like following file:

[source,json]
.newStatusResponse.json
----
include::../server/src/test/resources/gritter/StatusControllerIntegrationSpec/newStatusResponse.json[]
----

=== Exercise 2: Grails Controller Testing
____
You have created your first integration test but you are not happy. You were taught that integration tests are
unnecessarily slow and you should try to write unit test whereever it is possible. Try to rewrite the create status test
as a unit test. Keep the original test for comparison. Ensure that expected controller action is called during the test.
____

Unit tests no longer reside in `src/integration-test/groovy` but they are located in general `src/test/groovy` folder.
Copy `server/src/integration-test/groovy/gritter/StatusControllerIntegrationSpec.groovy` file to
`server/src/test/groovy/gritter/StatusControllerSpec.groovy`. Also copy content of `server/src/test/resources/gritter/StatusControllerIntegrationSpec`
to `server/src/test/resources/gritter/StatusControllerSpec`.

[source,groovy,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
.Gru Grails Setup
----
include::../server/src/test/groovy/gritter/StatusControllerBasicSpec.groovy[]
----
<1> Grails controller tests needs to implement `ControllerUnitTest` trait, `DataTest` enables mocking domain classes
<2> Use Gru with Grails client
<3> Gru uses and verifies information from URL mapping which needs to be supplied using `include` method
<4> If the controller action relies on interceptor logic, you can easily include the required interceptor
<5> We need to mock domain classes which are used within the test
<6> Creating new status requires existing user in the database
<7> The test call remains the same
<8> Only difference is a call which ensures which method from the controller is called

Every Grails's controller test must implement `grails.testing.web.controllers.ControllerUnitTest` trait. To setup `Gru`
with `Grails` client you should supply the `UrlMappings` describing the mapped URL and any interceptor on which the controller's logic rely.

==== Bonus Exercise

Write tests for other execution flows in the `save` method:

1. `User` header is missing
2. User with given username does not exist
3. Wrong or empty JSON payload is posted to the endpoint

=== Exercise 3: Preparing Testing Data

____
You have covered `save` method in your first Gru's controller unit test and you want to create another one for `index` action but you
lack the required data. It looks you should be able to use Dru to preload data for the controller test to get consistent
responses from the controller unit test.
____

==== Using Dru to Preload Data

Dru allows you to map existing data such as rendered JSON back to original entities. From running application you can
easily obtain the data in JSON format using HTTP client such as `cURL` or by simply opening the endpoint URL in the browser.

First run the server application in development mode:

[source,bash,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
----
./gradlew :server:bootRun
----

When the application is running you can save the JSON response for example using `cURL`:

[source,bash,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/status?max=25 > statuses.json
----

The content of the saved file `statuses.json` should look like following file but it should contain more entries:

[source,json,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
----
[
  {
    "id": 6,
    "created": "2018-02-23T12:18:50Z",
    "text": "Grooming snow close to Kirkintilloch",
    "user": {
      "id": 7,
      "username": "Ready Spready Go"
    },
    "engagementsCount": 5,
    "engagements": [
      {
        "id": 27,
        "created": "2018-03-02T12:31:46Z",
        "user": {
          "id": 4,
          "username": "The Snow Buster"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 28,
        "created": "2018-03-02T12:31:46Z",
        "user": {
          "id": 1,
          "username": "John Sno"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 29,
        "created": "2018-03-02T12:31:46Z",
        "user": {
          "id": 2,
          "username": "Ice Queen"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 30,
        "created": "2018-03-02T12:31:46Z",
        "user": {
          "id": 3,
          "username": "Snow Destroyer"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 31,
        "created": "2018-03-02T12:31:46Z",
        "user": {
          "id": 8,
          "username": "Gritty Gritty Bang Bang"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
----


Move this file to `server/src/test/resources/gritter/StatusControllerSpec/statuses.json` so
we can use it as source of data for our test.

[source,groovy,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
.Load Entities from JSON using Dru
----
include::../server/src/test/groovy/gritter/StatusControllerSpec.groovy[]
----
<1> Declare Dru plan to load data
<2> Load data from `statuses.json` we stored in previous step
<3> Every element in JSON array is mapped to `Status`
<4> Load the data before every test. you longer have to call `mockDomains` manually
<5> Gru test for index action
<6> Adding the URL parameters for pagination
<7> This file is generated automatically after first run, you may require to use some JsonUnit placeholders again
<8> You don't need to create and save the user manually any longer

==== Bonus Exercises
1. Verify call with different parameters - `sort` and `order`
2. Ensure all the data (properties) from `statuses.json` are loaded using `dru.report`

=== Exercise 4: Sharing Test Data

____
While you were wandering through the code of the application you have discovered method to fetch the top statuses for
given time period inside `StatusService`. You would like to cover this method with test but you will need the data you've
already defined in `StatusControllerSpec`.
____

==== Prepared Data Sets

You can easily reuse existing data set by creating a prepared data set. To do this you usually create a separate class:

[source,groovy,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
.StatusDataSets.groovy
----
include::../server/src/test/groovy/gritter/StatusDataSets.groovy[]
----
<1> Use `Dru.prepare` instead of `Dru.plan` if you want to create reusable data set

You need to move `server/src/test/resources/gritter/StatusControllerSpec/statuses.json` to
`server/src/test/resources/gritter/StatusDataSets/statuses.json` so it's accessible from the data set class.

It is good habit to write a separate test if the data are loaded properly so other tests can rely on them:

[source,groovy,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
.StatusDataSetsSpec.groovy
----
include::../server/src/test/groovy/gritter/StatusDataSetsSpec.groovy[]
----

WARNING: The counts and ids will be different in your tests depending on your `status.json` file!

Later on you can use the data set inside your test class by including it:

[source,groovy,indent=0,options="nowrap"]
.StatusServiceSpec.groovy
----
include::../server/src/test/groovy/gritter/StatusServiceSpec.groovy[]
----

WARNING: Expected results will be different based on content of your `status.json` file!

==== Bonus Exercises
1. Change method `findTopStatuses` to allow filter also by user
2. Expose `findTopStatuses` method in `StatusController` at `/status/top` URL and write a `Gru`
specification for it.
